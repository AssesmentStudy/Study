# Data-Structures-Assessment

## Summary
This assessment will be used to assess your understanding of the material provided in units 1 through 3. We'll be building an implementation of a linked list. At the end of the period, commit your work and submit a pull request. This is done solo. **DO NOT** look at previous code or ask your cohort-mates for help. However, your other resources (e.g. google, stack overflow) are allowed.

## How do I get started?
1. Fork this repo
1. Clone your fork
1. Complete the challenge in located in `src/main.js`.
  - You must implement the `add`, `delete`, and `count` functions on the LinkedList prototype. 
  - Each function is commented with its specifications. Implement the functions exactly as their documentation prescribes. You may assume the functions will be called with the types listed in their documentation.
  - **important** Be sure to return the specified return value from each function's documentation

## How do I know if my answer is correct?
There are no provided tests for this assessment. **The onus is on you to determine if your answer is correct.** You can test the behavior of your data structure in the chrome console, with node in the terminal, or any other JavaScript interpreter. 

## What about linting?
There is a custom eslint configuration for this assessment. To install locally, navigate to your data-structures-assessment directory in the terminal and run `npm install`.

## What do I do when I'm done?
1. When completed, commit and push your changes to your GitHub fork

1. Submit a pull request to the CodesmithLLC organization to the branch name matching your GitHub handle
  - click the pull request icon the on the left side of the screen 
  - click set the base of the pull request the specially created branch named after your GitHub handle
  - Add a title and comment to the pull request and then click the create pull request button
